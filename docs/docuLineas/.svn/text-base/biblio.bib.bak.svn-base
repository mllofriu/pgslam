  abstract = {{Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in
	the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring,
	and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly
	touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical
	robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of
	a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics
	as a modern scientific discipline. The Springer Handbook of Robotics
	brings a widespread and well-structured compilation of classic and
	emerging application areas of robotics. From the foundations to the
	social and ethical implications of robotics, the handbook provides
	a comprehensive collection of the accomplishments in the field, and
	constitutes a premise of further advances towards new challenges
	in robotics. This handbook, edited by two internationally renowned
	scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part
	editors and onehundred sixty-four authors, is an authoritative reference
	for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from
	related disciplines such as biomechanics, neurosciences, virtual
	simulation, animation, surgery, and sensor networks among others.}},
