  abstract = {{Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms
	have been used to great effect in flat, indoor environments such
	as corridors and offices. We demonstrate that with a few augmentations,
	existing 2D SLAM technology can be extended to perform full 3D SLAM
	in less benign, outdoor, undulating environments. In particular,
	we use data acquired with a 3D laser range finder. We use a simple
	segmentation algorithm to separate the data stream into distinct
	point clouds, each referenced to a vehicle position. The SLAM technique
	we then adopt inherits much from 2D delayed state (or scan-matching)
	SLAM in that the state vector is an ever growing stack of past vehicle
	positions and inter-scan registrations are used to form measurements
	between them. The registration algorithm used is a novel combination
	of previous techniques carefully balancing the need for maximally
	wide convergence basins, robustness and speed. In addition, we introduce
	a novel post-registration classification technique to detect matches
	which have converged to incorrect local minima}},

	as an effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and

	particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly,
	a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this
	paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in
	a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute
	an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the
	movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This
	drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the
	prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach
	to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces
	the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out
	with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor,
	environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous

	which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with
	any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the
	surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common
	orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases)
	differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal
	to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists
	in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized,

	In our approach scan matching is used for minimizing odometric errors
	during mapping. A probabilistic model of the residual errors of scan
	matching process is then used for the resampling steps. This way
	the number of samples required is seriously reduced. Simultaneously
	we reduce the particle depletion problem that typically prevents
	the robot from closing large loops. We present extensive experiments

	by making recordings in monkeys actively walking in the laboratory.
	In a sample of 352 cells recorded in this situation, no "place" cells
	have so far been found. Instead, we have found a considerable population
	of "spatial view" cells tuned to respond when the monkey looks at
	small parts of the environment. We have been able to demonstrate
	(1) that these hippocampal neurons respond to a view of space "out
	there," not to the place where the monkey is; (2) that the responses
	depend on where the monkey is looking, by measuring eye position;
	(3) that the responses in some cases (e.g., CA1 but not CA3) still
	occur if the view details are obscured with curtains; (4) that the
	cells (in, e.g., CA1) retain part of their "space" tuning even in
	complete darkness, for several minutes; and (5) that the spatial
	representation is allocentric. The spatial representation is, thus,
	different from that in the rat hippocampus, in which place cells
	respond based on where the rat is located. The representation is
	also different from that described in the parietal cortex, where
	neurons respond in egocentric coordinates. This representation of
	space "out there" provided by primate spatial view cells would be
	an appropriate part of a memory system involved in memories of particular
	events or episodes, for example, of where in an environment an object
	was seen. Spatial view cells (in conjunction with whole body motion
	cells in the primate hippocampus, and head direction cells in the
	primate presubiculum) would also be useful as part of a spatial navigation
	system, for which they would provide a memory component.}},

  abstract = {{This paper is a study of the behavioral and spatial firing correlates
	of neurons in the rat postsubiculum. Recordings were made from postsubicular
	neurons as rats moved freely throughout a cylindrical chamber, where
	the major cue for orientation was a white card taped to the inside
	wall. An automatic video/computer system monitored cell discharge
	while simultaneously tracking the position of 2 colored light emitting
	diodes (LEDs) secured to the animal's head. The animal's location
	was calculated from the position of one of the LEDs and head direction
	in the horizontal plane calculated from the relative positions of
	the 2 LEDs. Approximately 26\% of the cells were classified as head-direction
	cells because they discharged as a function of the animal's head
	direction in the horizontal plane, independent of the animal's behavior,
	location, or trunk position. For each head-direction cell, vectors
	drawn in the direction of maximal firing were parallel throughout
	the recording chamber and did not converge toward a single point.
	Plots of firing rate versus head direction showed that each firing-rate/head-direction
	function was adequately described by a triangular function. Each
	cell's maximum firing rate occurred at only one (the preferred) head
	direction; firing rates at head directions on either side of the
	preferred direction decreased linearly with angular deviation from
	the preferred direction. Results from 24 head-direction cells in
	7 animals showed an equal distribution of preferred firing directions
	over a 360 degrees angle. The peak firing rate of head-direction
	cells varied from 5 to 115 spikes/sec (mean: 35). The range of head-direction
	angles over which discharge was elevated (directional firing range)
	was usually about 90 degrees, with little, if any, discharge at head
	directions outside this range. Quantitative analysis showed the location
	of the animal within the cylinder had minimal effect on directional
	cell firing. For each head-direction cell, the preferred direction,
	peak firing rate, and directional firing range remained stable for
	days. These results identify a new cell type that signals the animal's
	head direction in its environment.}},
